                                When we begin our brainstorming, we decided to improve from last time with simpicity and only look for two aspect - Things To Have & Things Not To Have. We include all the features that can be found
                                in party rooms in real life and those which people are generally interested in, for example, video games, board games, Karaoke and more. But we also decied to add in things that are rarely found in real life 
                                party rooms, such as amazing 360 view, and large performace stage. However, even we wanted to add in all the jaw-dropping features, we also had to address things shouldn't be added. As we are creating 
                                a Virtual reality scene, we are aware of the capability of mozilla hub, complicated controls simply cannot be achieved, the technology isn't there yet.

                                In here, we have conducted a speed dating to explain the idea with storyboard. And we got positives comments, however respondent had some question for the project such as what the theme of our party room design is, is that hard to control.
                                After we did the speed dating, we have evaluated that our we should have a intriguing theme on party room design, and the simple is the key, we do not make the objects in party room are hard to control.

                                The foundation of our party room, is designed by ourselves using Blender. We originally looked up for built assest in Sketchfab, however none of them meet the need of the model we are looking for. Crucially, 
                                a actual window that allow light pass through is very important to our design and Sketchfab doesn't have any of those unforunately.

                                Shaders for the transparent window<br><br>
                                We spent a lot of time trying to understand how the shaders work in blender. Once we figured that out, we faced another problem of the format support by spoke - glTF2.0 has a lot of restrictions on shaders. 
                                At last, we came up with a specific shader using a coloured version of an alpha map for transparent window found online and convert the coloured code into black and white before exporting the blender object into glTF2.0.

                                We implemented some movement restrictive waypoints on to chairs and sofa, it is to simulate the real life situation of seating next to each other and not being able to move around. 
                                We also set up teleportation waypoints to allow movement through long distance and empty space, also can used as escape from bugged situations.

                            I had great excitement for this topic, as I have always been interested in Virtual reality. But the reality is, I had no idea how challenging to design a VR scene. This time I was given the role to design the scene. 
                            So I would have some thoughts regarding my experience using spoke. 
                              First of all, the design tools given, which is spoke, is web-based and has very limited options. I understand that for a free and open VR platform, it is already a gift from heaven, however, spoke is indeed very difficult to use. It has difficulty
                             navigating around in the scene, objects can only be moved using the 3 transfrom parameter, xyz, and isn't able to snap on other ojects like in blender. From my experience, when the angle doesn't line up, it will take 
                             a lot of micro adjustments just to put the objects in the right place. I could proudly say project 3 definitely trained me to be patient and to control my inner urging annoyance.
                              Secondly, during the brainstorming, we have had creative ideas, for example the interactive playground was supposed to be consisting four coloured plate with sensors, that could sense people's movemnet on top of it. However, 
                              we definitely overestimated what we could do with spoke, there is barely any elements for interactive purposes provided by it other than putting in videos, some sounds and images. From this, I learn that always try out the tools before you dream about what it can do. 
                              Thirdly, resource management, as a cs minor student, I have never experienced the importance of keeping your resources low and efficient, when we were building the prototype, we had the urge to put every pretty decorations in the scene, 
                              to the point the resources we used exceed the limit of mozilla hub by more than 5 times... I admitt that I had never considered resource management at that time, and I could've instead use a similar looking asset that takes up much fewer resources.

                            Nonetheless, I learnt a lot through frustration this time, but I still had a lot of fun and had a enjoyable time working with my groupmates, So I would say the time was worth it.
